# 👋 Hey, I’m Omkar

> *“There’s a lot of noise in the world of AI. I focus on building the parts that quietly deliver value.”* 🤖✨

I'm an **AI Product Manager** with a background in **product**, **data**, and an **MBA from IIM Nagpur** 🎓.  
Over the years, I’ve collaborated with sharp, cross-functional teams to bring practical AI solutions into the real world—developing tools that improved **📈 marketing ROI**, enhanced **🚚 supply chain efficiency**, and elevated **💡 customer experience** across industries.

These weren’t just projects—they were products that shipped, got adopted, and solved real problems.
